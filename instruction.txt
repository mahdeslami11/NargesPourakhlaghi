In oreder to compile the desired code the following stages must be taken:
1.install pycharm
2.install pip python --upgrade
the python version =3.8 ( it is necessary)
3. pip instal pip --upgrade
4. inistall anaconda ( it takes time)
after the anaconda is inistalled the environment in conda based on python 3.8 is made.
5.the below libraries should be add in order to use them in code.
diart,tourch,tourchaudio,py
6.conda create -n diart python=3.9
7.conda activate diart
8.conda create -n diart python=3.8
9.conda activate diart
10.pip install diart
11.pyannote.audio should be installed
12. the terms of MIT have to be consented by user by following the

13. order the token for login open the below link:
14. pip install huggingface_hub
15.conda install -c conda-forge huggingface_hub
16. use the token code for logging to the MIT database
17.the main.py must be run
18. please enter the token number 
19. after compile the main.py
20. the script turn the laptop's speaker on and the voice of speaker are saved every 0.5 in buffers.
21. by using pipeline all voices are recorded and according to the frequency the speaker voices is regognize.
22. the network will be trained by 5 sec recording
